This project is a customized javascript interpreter that uses rinho. The main interpreter instance ScriptingInstance, allows to load 
packaged .jar plugins, which permits to extend the javascript language with sets of own java functions.
One of the main aims of this project was the modular, and independ development of our very adhesive projects. I.e, our currenct projects
requires image, spectra and molecular feature extractions that has to be analised futher by machine learning methods, or just that have to
be compared and formated to be presented in and HTML form. Well, the use of this very simple glue, had allowed our team to deal in an almost
independed way, the development of all those complex projects.
